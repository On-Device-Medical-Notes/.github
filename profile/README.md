# On Device Medical Notes
On Device Medical Notes is an open-source community dedicated to developing tools for on-device medical transcription and note creation. Our mission is to empower healthcare professionals with secure, efficient, and user-friendly solutions that enhance patient care.

## Our Objectives:

Develop Open-Source Tools: Create and maintain open-source models and applications for on-device medical transcription and note generation.


## Rigorous Testing: 

Implement comprehensive testing protocols to ensure the accuracy, reliability, and security of our tools.


## Research and Publication: 

Conduct clinical research to evaluate our models, with the goal of publishing findings in reputable journals.


## Software Goals:


Our ideal software will run in browsers on most modern computers equipped with 8 GB of RAM and a generic GPU. In the future, we aim to extend compatibility to mobile devices, including iPhones and other tablets, to facilitate on-the-go medical documentation.
